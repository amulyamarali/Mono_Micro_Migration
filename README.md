## Monolithic to Microservices Migration for E-commerce Website

This repo provides step-by-step instructions for migrating an existing monolithic e-commerce website to a microservices architecture using the strangler pattern. We'll be using React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas as the database.

### Overview

The strangler pattern involves gradually replacing parts of the monolithic application with microservices until the entire system is composed of loosely-coupled services. This approach allows for incremental changes without disrupting the existing functionality.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas

### Steps for Migration

#### 1. Initial Setup
- Set up a new repository for the microservices architecture.
- Create directories for each microservice: user, product, order, etc.
- Initialize React frontend and Flask backend in separate directories.

#### 2. Identify Boundaries
- Identify boundaries in the monolithic application where microservices can be extracted.
- Focus on high-traffic or standalone features like user management, product catalog, and order processing.

#### 3. Create Microservices
- Start by creating microservices for user management, product catalog, and order processing.
- Implement CRUD operations for each microservice using Flask for backend logic and MongoDB Atlas for data storage.

#### 4. Gateway Setup
- Set up an API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms at the gateway level.

#### 5. Gradual Migration
- Gradually migrate endpoints from the monolithic application to corresponding microservices.
- Monitor performance and ensure functionality is not affected during the migration process.

#### 6. Integration and Testing
- Integrate microservices with the React frontend.
- Perform comprehensive testing to ensure all features are working as expected.

#### 7. Decommission Monolithic Code
- Once all features have been migrated, decommission the monolithic codebase.
- Monitor system performance and make any necessary optimizations.

### Conclusion

Migrating from a monolithic to microservices architecture using the strangler pattern requires careful planning and execution. By following the steps outlined in this guide and leveraging React, Flask, and MongoDB Atlas, you can successfully modernize your e-commerce application while ensuring scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

For further assistance or detailed implementation steps, refer to the documentation of React, Flask, and MongoDB Atlas, or seek help from experienced developers familiar with microservices architecture.
